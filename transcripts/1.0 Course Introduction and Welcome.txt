00:01 Welcome to managing Python dependencies with pip and virtual environments.
00:06 Dependency management and managing third party Python packages 
00:10 is a super important topic for any professional Python developer. 
00:14 In my experience, even if you begin with a simple question 
00:19 like how do I install a third party Python package, 
00:22 you can quickly go down a rabbit hole of other tools 
00:25 and new questions that pop up, and it can quickly get overwhelming. 
00:29 This course will be your one-stop shop 
00:32 for becoming proficient at dependency management with Python. 
00:35 Let's take a look at the course goals. 
00:38 By the end of the course, you will know how to install, use and manage 
00:45 third party Python packages with the pip package manager; 
00:49 you will know how to isolate your project dependencies 
00:52 with so called virtual environments; 
00:55 you will know a complete workflow for finding and identifying 
00:59 quality third party packages that you can use in your own Python projects. 
01:04 You will also know how to set up repeatable development environments 
01:07 and application deployments with a complete workflow
01:10 for that using requirements files. 
01:13 If you're wondering who the disembodied voice inside your computer is, 
01:19 hey that is me, Dan Bader, I am a complete Python nut 
01:24 and I would love to help you improve your Python skills. 
01:27 I started writing code when I was eight years old and was hacking away 
01:30 on my Commodore 64, and I never stopped since. 
01:34 Programming is a complete passion for me 
01:37 and I eventually got a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science.
01:40 I worked in full time positions for a few years, 
01:43 first as a software engineer, and then later as a lead developer 
01:46 and today I am an independent software developer and consultant, 
01:49 I run a number of Python projects and I've also been a speaker 
01:53 at various conferences around the world. 
01:56 If you want some more Python learning resources, 
01:58 check out my website at dbader.org 
02:01 I've got tons more tutorials and videos that will help you master Python.
02:05 Alright, enough about me, let's take a look at the course curriculum. 
02:08 Right now, you're in the first module on the course 
02:12 "The welcome and course overview" module. 
02:15 Every time I show you the course curriculum, 
02:18 I will always highlight in bold text where you are at the moment. 
02:21 So next up you'll dive into "Managing third party dependencies with Pip" 
02:26 and then after that, you'll learn how to isolate your project dependencies 
02:31 with virtual environments. 
02:33 In the fourth module, you'll learn a complete workflow 
02:36 for finding and researching quality Python packages. 
02:39 Next, you'll learn how to set up reproducible environment and application deploys. 
02:44 And finally, in the sixth module 
02:48 there will be the course conclusion and a quick recap. 
02:51 That's the course curriculum.
02:54 Now, this will be a really practical course, 
02:57 in each module you'll encounter a mixture of slight base presentations 
03:01 and hands on life demos, so you can see and follow along with the exact workflows
03:07 that I used to research and find Python packages 
03:10 or to manage dependencies in my own Python projects. 
03:16 Well, congratulations, you've just completed the first module in the course. 
03:20 Time to jump in and learn about managing third party dependencies with pip.
